# FCC Music Player
 A follow along project by freeCodeCamp

### Scope of the Projects
The HTML and CSS files were provided by freeCodeCamp. As a result, I only worked through the JavaScript from scratch.

## What I learned

### Web Audio API
All modern web browsers support the Web Audio API. You can add a new HTML Audio Element using the Audio() constructor

### Spread Operator
I used the spread operator [...] to copy elements from one array into another. Upon some further reading, I discovered the spread operator can also be used on strings as well. In addition, I made a mental note to not confuse the spread operator with the rest parameter syntax (...).

### Arrow Funcions
Throughout this project, I used arrow functions exclusively alongside the map() method.

### Template Literals
Once again, template literals with placeholders were used throughout the project.

# FCC Music Player
 A follow along project by freeCodeCamp

### Scope of the Projects
The HTML and CSS files were provided by freeCodeCamp. As a result, I only worked through the JavaScript from scratch.

## What I learned

### map() method
The map() method is used to iterate through an array and return a new array.

### Callback function
A callback function is a function that is used as an argument of another function.

### Web Audio API
All modern web browsers support the Web Audio API. You can add a new HTML Audio Element using the Audio() constructor

### Spread Operator
I used the spread operator [...] to copy elements from one array into another. Upon some further reading, I discovered the spread operator can also be used on strings as well. In addition, I made a mental note to not confuse the spread operator with the rest parameter syntax (...).

### Arrow Funcions
Throughout this project, I used arrow functions exclusively alongside the map() method.

### Template Literals
Once again, template literals with substitution of placeholders were used throughout the project.

#### String Interpolation
Using template literals, I created string interpolation instead of string concatenation to improve the readability of the code.

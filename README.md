# FCC Music Player
 A follow along project by freeCodeCamp

# Scope of the Projects
The HTML and CSS files were provided by freeCodeCamp. As a result, I only worked through the JavaScript from scratch.

# What I Learned

## map() method
The map() method is used to iterate through an array and return a new array.

## join() method
The join() method concatenates all the elements of an array into a single string. In addition, I used the optional parameter to separate the strings.

## add() method
I used the add() method alongside the classList property to add classes to HTML elements.

## remove() method
I used the remove() method alongside the classList property to remove classes from HTML elements.

## removeAttribute() method
I used the Element method removeAttribte() to remove ARIA attributes.

## setAttribte() method
I used the Element method setAttribute() to set the value of ARIA and boolean attributes. The setAttribute can take more than one argument.

## forEach() method
The forEach() method loops through and array and performs a function on each element of the array.

## Callback function
A callback function is a function that is used as an argument of another function.

## Web Audio API
All modern web browsers support the Web Audio API. You can add a new HTML Audio Element using the Audio() constructor

## Spread Operator
I used the spread operator [...] to copy elements from one array into another. Upon some further reading, I discovered the spread operator can also be used on strings as well. In addition, I made a mental note to not confuse the spread operator with the rest parameter syntax (...).

## Sort Operator
The sort() method converts elements of an array strings and returns them based on their UTF-16 encoding. This method was used to sort the order of the songs alphabetically. 

## Find Method
The find() method returns the first element in an array that meets the specified conditions.

### Sort Compare Callback Function
Using the compare calback function (a.name < b.name) we can return string values according to their lexicographical order.

## Arrow Funcions
Throughout this project, I used arrow functions exclusively alongside the map() method.

## Template Literals
Once again, template literals with substitution of placeholders were used throughout the project.

### String Interpolation
Using template literals, I created string interpolation ${}instead of string concatenation to improve the readability of the code.

## Optional Chaning
The optional chaining operator (?.) can be used to help prevent throwing an error. First, it accesses an object property, or function. However, if object or function is called and returns nullish (null or undefined), the expression evaluates instead to undefined.
